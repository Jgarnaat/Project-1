# Hotspot Finder

## Description
Hotspot Finder is a user-friendly hotspot locator app powered by Google Maps and WiGLE APIs. The app was created as a part of Michigan State University's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. This was a sandbox-style group challenge, to engineer an app that solves a real world problem. Our team selected the concept of a hotspot locator. Our app allows users to find nearby hotspots to connect their devices on the go, by simply searching their postal code. We challenged ourselves to create an app with clean design and robust functionality. 


## Usage
The deployed appâ€™s URL is https://Jgarnaat.github.io/Hot-Spot-Finder. Screenshots can be viewed below. In order to use the Hotspot Finder app, please use the search bar to look up nearby hotspots by postal code. The app saves the user's last five searches for easy access. The repository for this project can be found at https://github.com/Jgarnaat/Hot-Spot-Finder.
